[wiki-security-passportjs](https://github.com/ig3/wiki-security-passportjs)
is a fork of
[fedwiki/wiki-security-passportjs](https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki-security-passportjs)
which I made in June 2020. Primary motivation was to add support for
authentication to Office 365 / Azure AD.

As of 16 June 2020, I have authentication to Office 365 / Azure AD working
on a test install of [Federated Wiki](https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki), but
I have not yet committed changes to this repository. I hope to do that
before too long, but have been busy exploring the wiki.
